## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-option-trade-tracker.git
cd stock-option-trade-tracker
```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Install in development mode**:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Encrypted Database

```python
from trade_tracker.database.encryption import DatabaseEncryption
from trade_tracker.database.connection import DatabaseManager

# Generate encryption key (store this securely!)
key = DatabaseEncryption.generate_key()
DatabaseEncryption.save_key(key, "path/to/secure/location/.key")

# Or derive from password
password = "your_strong_password"
salt = os.urandom(16)  # Store this
key = DatabaseEncryption.derive_key_from_password(password, salt)
```

### 2. Track Your First Trade

```python
from trade_tracker.models.trade import StockTrade
from datetime import datetime

# Create a stock trade
trade = StockTrade(
    symbol="AAPL",
    trade_type="buy",
    quantity=100,
    price=150.50,
    commission=1.00,
    trade_date=datetime.now()
)

print(f"Total cost: ${trade.total_cost}")
```

### 3. Track Options

```python
from trade_tracker.models.trade import OptionTrade
from datetime import date

# Create an option trade
option = OptionTrade(
    symbol="AAPL",
    trade_type="buy_to_open",
    quantity=10,
    price=5.50,
    strike=155.00,
    expiry=date(2024, 3, 15),
    option_type="call",
    commission=6.50,
    trade_date=datetime.now()
)

print(f"Total cost: ${option.total_cost}")
```

## Development

### Testing

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles.

Run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

Run with coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=trade_tracker --cov-report=html
```

Run specific test file:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_models.py -v
```

### Code Quality

Format code with Black:
```bash
black src/ tests/
```

Sort imports with isort:
```bash
isort src/ tests/
```

Type checking with mypy:
```bash
mypy src/
```

## Security

### Data Encryption
- All trade data is encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- Encryption keys are never stored in the codebase
- Use password-based key derivation for user-friendly security
- Keys can be stored in secure key files with restricted permissions (0600)

### Broker API Security
- All broker integrations are **read-only**
- API credentials are encrypted in the local database
- No data is sent to third parties
- You maintain full control of your trading data

### Best Practices
1. **Never commit** your encryption keys or API credentials
2. Store keys in secure locations outside the repository
3. Use strong passwords for key derivation
4. Regularly backup your encrypted database
5. Keep dependencies updated for security patches

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Database
DB_PATH=./data/trades.db
DB_KEY_PATH=./config/.db_encryption.key

# Broker API Keys (encrypted at rest)
IBKR_ACCOUNT=
IBKR_API_KEY=

MOOMOO_ACCOUNT=
MOOMOO_API_KEY=

QUESTRADE_ACCOUNT=
QUESTRADE_API_KEY=

# Dashboard
DASHBOARD_PORT=8050
DASHBOARD_HOST=localhost
```
